Filters for blocking pop-ups and anti-adblock bypass and also BSNL injecting ads into your sessions (which should be illegal but sigh).

If the installation link to the filter doesn't work, the filter can be installed manually using step-by-step installation instructions.

Click on the "Apply Changes" button in the top left corner of the screen. As soon as the sheet is loaded you will see it in the "Custom" filters field.

_The blocker should be up and running._
